# Hi :wave: I am RJ Lindelof! :facepunch:
:fire: As a seasoned leader with decades of experience, I am passionate about building and scaling high-performing global engineering teams by championing a world-class Developer Experience (DevEx). My approach centers on investing in robust CI/CD, comprehensive observability, and empowering self-service tooling, which together reduce friction, enable faster and safer deploys, and deliver better feedback loops across the entire engineering organization. I achieve this by fostering a culture of excellence and collaboration, uniting diverse talent-from onshore to offshore, full-time staff to strategic partners-to deliver exceptional platform services.

:zap: As I expand my expertise in AI and machine learning, I'm focused on the practical and responsible integration of AI tools across the software development lifecycle. From code generation to test automation and product optimization. I evaluate AI's capabilities not just as accelerators--but as tools that require critical thinking, awareness of bias, and respect for data privacy. I am actively developing internal guidelines that promote ethical adoption, protect sensitive data, and help teams use AI intentionally and responsibly.

:thumbsup: I am always looking for new opportunities. Let's connect and build the future together! ðŸŒŸ

:thinking: When it comes to problem-solving, my Agile mindset shines through, adapting seamlessly to various methodologies. I thrive in Agile environments, where I've helped teams grow, learn, measure and mentor each other.
